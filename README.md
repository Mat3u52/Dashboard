# Dashboard - AXI:
## The draft of the project in the Django framework. My first steps.
## The application is for preparing production instructions for the X-Ray inspection area. These instructions are necessary because different customers have different X-Ray inspection requirements.
The quality department will fill in the information and then it will be shown in the production area for Inspectors working on AXI.
